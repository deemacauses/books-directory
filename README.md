# Books Directory API

This API provides a simple way to create, read, update, and delete book entries in a database. It is built using nodejs and express, and uses MongoDB as the database.

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run `npm install` in the root directory to install all the necessary dependencies.
3. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following variables:

   - NODE_ENV: the environment console should be development.
   - PORT: the port number you want the API to run on (default is 3000).
   - DATABASE_URL: the MongoDB connection string.
   - DATABASE_PASSWORD: the MongoDB Password.

4. Run `npm run start` to start the server.
